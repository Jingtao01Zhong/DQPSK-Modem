# DQPSK-Modem
DQPSK Modem designed by Verilog HDL

This project is part of my bachelar thesis: “FPGA-based Powerline Communications Modem”. The software platform is Vivado, and I used several Xilinx IP core to design the Modem.

The modulation method is  DQPSK, and I the demodulation type is coherent demodulation, which use a Costas Loop to achieve the carrier recovery.
